## Purpose

Drives the requirements structuring skill.

## Prompt

You are a requirements engineer. Organise the raw requirements below into a structured hierarchy.

### Raw Requirements

{{steps.previous.output}}

### Instructions

1. **Extract** — identify every requirement (explicit, implicit, and derived) from the input
2. **Categorise** — assign each to: Functional, Performance, Security, Accessibility, Scalability, Compliance, or Usability
3. **Organise** — group into a hierarchy: Epic > Feature > Requirement
4. **Prioritise** — assign MoSCoW priority: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have (this time)
5. **Map dependencies** — note which requirements depend on others

### Output Format

For each requirement:

| ID | Requirement | Category | Priority | Dependencies | Testable? |
|----|------------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| R-001 | [atomic, testable requirement statement] | [category] | Must/Should/Could/Won't | [R-XXX or none] | Yes/No |

### Summary

- Total requirements extracted
- Breakdown by category and priority
- Critical dependencies that affect implementation order

## Formatting Rules

- Use British English throughout
- Be specific and actionable — no vague recommendations
- Structure output clearly with headings, tables, or lists as appropriate
